# A learning-Rust machine-learning project

| :warning: This project is a learning exercise. For example, external, numerical analysis packages have been avoided.  |

| :warning: This results of this project do not represent a serious attempt at literary analysis. Very little effort has been spent on verifying transcriptions or tracking down similar subject matters. Daniel Defoe's works are notoriously difficult to attribute, and traditional attributions made by humans should obviously be favored instead of this exercise.   |

## Goal
To someday say something provocative about some digitized works, especially about the attribution of *A General History of the Pyrates* (1724) to Daniel Defoe.

## Repository contents
* Basic perceptron, testing with Fisher's famous [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).
* Shallow feature-analysis on digitized texts (unique words, sentence length, hapax legomena, etc.)
* ...
