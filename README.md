# A learning-Rust machine-learning project

## Goal
To someday say something interesting about some digitized works, especially about the attribution of *A General History of the Pyrates* (1724) to Daniel Defoe.

## Contents
* Basic perceptron, testing with Fisher's famous [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).
* Shallow feature-analysis on digitized texts (unique words, sentence length, hapax legomena, etc.)
